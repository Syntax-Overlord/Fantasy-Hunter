# Fantasy Hunter

I'm making significant changes and revamping the game to complete it more efficiently. Please disregard the **v0.3** and **v0.4** versions. Why?

> *I want to finish the game faster, as the old system was messy. I plan to remove the older versions and keep only the latest one, though I'll probably preserve the old versions as they represent my Python learning journey. I admit I left them incomplete during development, but this time this is my primary Python project. While I'm focusing on other projects in languages like Java and Dart, Python is my first language. Whenever I return to coding in Python, this project will not only show my progress but also serve as good practice.*

Please focus on **v0.5** and future versions..
