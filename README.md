# **Fantasy Hunter - A Text-Based RPG**

## **About the Project**

Welcome to Fantasy Hunter, a text-based RPG that I started as a proof of my progress in game development. This project is in beta, and I plan to update it every 1 to 2 months with new features, improvements, and hidden Easter eggs referencing things I enjoy.

The game is designed to be a fun, interactive experience where players can create their own character, explore a vast world, and take on challenges in a fantasy setting. While it's still in development, I plan to add more mechanics, better interactions, and a full combat system in future updates.

## **Features (So Far)**

- ✅ Character Creation – Choose your name, gender, and class.
- ✅ Stat System – Customize your stats or have them randomly assigned.
- ✅ Skill System – Each class starts with unique skills.
- ✅ Basic Exploration & Choices – Start your journey in a fantasy world.
- ✅ Random Events & Interactive Story Elements – Read books, make choices, and explore different paths.

## **Planned Features**

- 🚀 Combat System – Turn-based battles with enemies.
- 🚀 Inventory System – Collect, use, and manage items.
- 🚀 Expanded World & Story – More locations, quests, and lore.
- 🚀 Easter Eggs – Hidden references to things I like.
- 🚀 Designed UI Version – A visually enhanced version with pixel art and improved interface.
- 🚀 Turn-Based Combat System – Inspired by classic RPGs but with a medieval knights theme.
- 🚀 Complete Story Mode – A fully developed narrative adventure.
- 🚀 Web & Mobile Versions – Future versions using Java, web development, and UI/UX design.

## **Disclaimer**

I am not a professional programmer and still a beginner in game development. This is a side project, and the code may be messy or unoptimized. If you notice any issues or have suggestions, feel free to contact me via email—I am always looking to improve and learn!

As I develop my skills in web development, Java, UI/UX design (Figma), and pixel art, I plan to design a full graphical version of this game. It will feature a well-designed UI, pixel-art visuals, and an improved combat system inspired by classic RPG mechanics. However, I will continue to maintain the text-based version, ensuring it remains updated with the latest features and story developments.

By the time you're reading this, I may have already implemented some of these features!
